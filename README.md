# Stack

A simple implementation of a stack data structure in Java. This repository provides the basic operations of a stack, including `push`, `pop`, and `peek`, along with utility methods to check if the stack is empty or full.

## Introduction
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The `Stack` class in this repository provides a basic implementation of the stack, with methods to perform stack operations such as adding (push), removing (pop), and accessing the top element (peek).

## Features
- **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Removes the top element of the stack and returns it.
- **Peek**: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
- **isFull**: Checks if the stack has reached its maximum capacity.
